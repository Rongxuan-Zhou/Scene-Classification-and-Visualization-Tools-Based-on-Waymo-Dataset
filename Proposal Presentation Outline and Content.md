## Slide 2: Problem Description

**Problem Statement:**

- Autonomous driving systems require accurate scene understanding to ensure safety and performance.
- Existing datasets, such as Waymo's, provide rich sensor data (camera images, LiDAR point clouds) but lack intuitive, interactive tools for effective scene classification and visualization.
- Current visualization methods are often static or limited in interactivity, hindering comprehensive analysis and real-time insights.

**Objective:**

- Develop interactive visualization tools that classify driving scenes (urban, suburban, nighttime, etc.) effectively using the Waymo dataset.
- Facilitate dynamic exploration of different driving scenarios through user-friendly interfaces.
