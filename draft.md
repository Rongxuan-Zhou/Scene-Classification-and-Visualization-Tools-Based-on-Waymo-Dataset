Hi guys, we are excited to share  our project proposal titled 'Scene-Classification-and-Visualization-Tools-Based-on-Waymo-Dataset.'

To begin with, let me briefly introduce Waymo. Waymo is a leader in autonomous driving technology, formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project. 
Since its inception in 2009, Waymo has been at the forefront of innovation in this field, with its autonomous driving services completing over 200,000 rides weekly.

The Waymo Open Dataset is a rich and diverse collection of synchronized LiDAR point clouds and high-resolution camera images. It spans various driving scenarios such as urban and suburban areas, day and night conditions, providing researchers with invaluable resources to advance autonomous vehicle technologies."

Slide 2: Problem Description
"Autonomous driving systems require precise scene understanding to ensure safety and performance. However, despite the richness of datasets like Waymo's—offering detailed sensor data such as camera images and LiDAR point clouds—existing tools for scene classification and visualization remain limited.

Current visualization methods are often static or lack interactivity, making it difficult for researchers to dynamically analyze complex driving scenarios. This hinders real-time insights that are crucial for improving autonomous systems.

Our objective is clear: to develop interactive visualization tools that classify driving scenes—such as urban, suburban, nighttime conditions—and enable dynamic exploration through user-friendly interfaces. This is not just about creating better charts; it's about empowering researchers to interact with data as dynamically as vehicles experience the road."

Transition from Slide 2 to Slide 3
so let’s now delve into why solving this problem is both necessary and impactful for autonomous driving systems and beyond."

Slide 4: Proposed Approach
"Our solution involves three key steps:

Data Preparation: 
We will process the Waymo Open Dataset using Python libraries to clean and organize sensor data effectively.

Scene Classification: 
Machine learning models will be used to classify different driving scenarios—such as urban streets versus suburban environments—based on specific scene features extracted from the dataset.

Interactive Visualization Development: 
Using Foxglove Studio, we will design dynamic visualizations that include:

Custom panels displaying scene classification results;
Statistical visualizations like heatmaps and bar charts;
Advanced 3D point cloud visualizations for immersive exploration of driving scenarios
